# --max-parallel-test-modules 1 forces the Tests and UiTests projects to run one after
# another rather than concurrently: both spawn real child processes (git subprocesses,
# FlaUI-driven app instances), and running them at the same time causes intermittent,
# non-deterministic contention failures between the two (confirmed via live CI runs).
