## LauncherUI

### Verification Approach

The `LauncherUI` subsystem is verified by the combined unit tests of its four units
(`MainWindowViewModelTests.cs`, `RepoCardViewModelTests.cs`,
`SelectPackageWindowViewModelTests.cs`, `SettingsWindowViewModelTests.cs`), which together
exercise the full recent-repos/card/select-package/settings interaction surface without ever
constructing an Avalonia `Window`. At the subsystem boundary, collaborating subsystems
(`AgentPackageManagement`, `RepoSync`, `RepoConfig`, `GitIntegration`, `AgentToolLauncher`,
`Settings`) are exercised through their real implementations against real temporary
directories and package-zip fixtures, and git is substituted with a stub script (`GitStub`,
shared with `GitClientTests`) so no test depends on a real git installation. The one
end-to-end path not covered by any unit test — the About command, which has no dedicated
view-model class — is verified only via the FlaUI `DemaConsulting.AgentControl.UiTests`
project.

### Test Environment

Unit tests run under xUnit v3 using unique temporary configuration and repo directories per
test (hermetic, parallel-safe). Tests that construct a `MainWindowViewModel` or
`RepoCardViewModel` run in the `RealProcess` xUnit collection (disabled parallelization)
because eager `RefreshCheap()` calls spawn real subprocesses via `GitStub` or the system git
executable.

### Acceptance Criteria

- All unit tests pass with zero failures.
- Every documented UI action (add/remove repo, search/sort, launch, pull, select package,
  upgrade, settings, about) produces its documented observable outcome.
- Removal requires explicit confirmation; no test path removes a card without it.
- Status badges (upgrade-available, missing-repo, committed-files) reflect the correct
  underlying state for both normal and boundary conditions.

### Test Scenarios

**LauncherUI_RecentReposDisplay_ConstructorPopulatesCards**: `MainWindowViewModel` is
constructed from settings containing two recent repos; both appear as cards in order. This
scenario is tested by `MainWindowViewModel_Constructor_SettingsHaveRecentRepos_PopulatesRepoCards`,
covering `AgentControl-LauncherUI-RecentReposDisplay`.

**LauncherUI_StatusBadges_UpgradeMissingAndCommittedFilesBadgesReflectState**: A repo card is
refreshed under three conditions — a newer package version available, a repo path that no
longer exists, and an unchanged HEAD hash — and the upgrade, missing-repo, and cached
committed-files badges are each set correctly. This scenario is tested by
`RepoCardViewModel_Refresh_NewerVersionAtSource_SetsUpgradeAvailableTrue`,
`RepoCardViewModel_RefreshCheap_RepoPathDoesNotExist_SetsIsMissingAndSuppressesOtherState`, and
`RepoCardViewModel_RefreshCheap_UnchangedHeadHash_CommittedFilesBadgeIsCached`, covering
`AgentControl-LauncherUI-StatusBadges`.

**LauncherUI_AddRepo_ValidDuplicateAndMissingPaths_ProduceCorrectOutcomes**: `AddRepo` is
called with a valid new folder path (inserted and persisted), a nonexistent path (rejected),
and an already-tracked path (rejected). This scenario is tested by
`MainWindowViewModel_AddRepo_ValidNewPath_InsertsCardAndPersistsSettings`,
`MainWindowViewModel_AddRepo_PathDoesNotExist_ReturnsFalse`, and
`MainWindowViewModel_AddRepo_DuplicatePath_ReturnsFalse`, covering
`AgentControl-LauncherUI-AddRepo`.

**LauncherUI_RemoveRepo_RequiresConfirmationBeforeMutatingState**: A card's `RemoveCommand` is
executed (raising `RemoveRequested` without removing the card), and `MainWindowViewModel`'s
own `RemoveRepo` is called separately (removing the card and persisting settings), proving
removal is a two-step, confirmation-gated flow. This scenario is tested by
`MainWindowViewModel_RemoveRepo_RemovesFromCollectionsAndPersistsSettings` and
`MainWindowViewModel_CardRaisesRemoveRequested_DoesNotRemoveCardWithoutConfirmation`, covering
`AgentControl-LauncherUI-RemoveRepo`.

**LauncherUI_SearchFilter_MatchesNameOrPathCaseInsensitively**: `FilterText` is set to a
substring that matches only one repo's display name, then to a substring that matches only by
full path; in both cases only the matching card remains displayed. This scenario is tested by
`MainWindowViewModel_FilterText_MatchesRepoNameCaseInsensitive_FiltersDisplayedRepoCards` and
`MainWindowViewModel_FilterText_MatchesRepoPath_FiltersDisplayedRepoCards`, covering
`AgentControl-LauncherUI-SearchFilter`.

**LauncherUI_SortOrder_FavoritesFirstThenMostRecentlyLaunched**: Displayed cards are checked
for favorites sorting above non-favorites regardless of launch recency, and for
most-recently-launched-first ordering within the same favorite tier with never-launched repos
last. This scenario is tested by
`MainWindowViewModel_DisplayedRepoCards_SortsFavoritesAboveNonFavorites` and
`MainWindowViewModel_DisplayedRepoCards_SortsByLastLaunchedUtcDescendingWithNullsLast`,
covering `AgentControl-LauncherUI-SortOrder`.

**LauncherUI_Launch_SucceedsOnlyAfterAgentFilesConfirmedSynced**: The Launch command is
executed for a card whose agent files are already synced, recording the launch timestamp; and
the ensure-synced check is exercised confirming it returns true without re-extracting when
folders are already present. This scenario is tested by
`RepoCardViewModel_LaunchCommand_Succeeds_RecordsLaunchTimestampAndRaisesLaunchRecorded` and
`RepoCardViewModel_EnsureAgentFilesSyncedBeforeLaunch_PinnedAndFoldersPresent_ReturnsTrueWithoutReExtracting`,
covering `AgentControl-LauncherUI-Launch`.

**LauncherUI_Pull_EnabledOnlyForCleanWorkingTree**: A card with a clean working tree reports
pull as enabled, a card with a dirty working tree reports it disabled, and executing
`PullCommand` on a clean repo updates the status message on success. This scenario is tested
by `RepoCardViewModel_Refresh_CleanWorkingTree_SetsCanPullTrue`,
`RepoCardViewModel_Refresh_DirtyWorkingTree_SetsCanPullFalse`, and
`RepoCardViewModel_PullCommand_SuccessfulPull_UpdatesStatusMessage`, covering
`AgentControl-LauncherUI-Pull`.

**LauncherUI_SelectPackage_BrowseAndApplyToUnpinnedRepo**: The select-package request is
raised with the configured source path, the selection window populates versions descending
and defaults to latest, confirming raises the selected pair, and applying the selected package
updates the pin, extracts the files, and raises release-notes-ready. This scenario is tested
by `RepoCardViewModel_SelectPackageCommand_SourceConfigured_RaisesSelectPackageRequestedWithSourcePath`,
`SelectPackageWindowViewModel_SelectPackageName_PopulatesVersionsDescendingAndDefaultsToLatest`,
`SelectPackageWindowViewModel_ConfirmCommand_RaisesConfirmedWithSelectedPair`, and
`RepoCardViewModel_ApplySelectedPackage_ValidNameAndVersion_UpdatesPinAndExtractsAndRaisesReleaseNotesReady`,
covering `AgentControl-LauncherUI-SelectPackage`.

**LauncherUI_Upgrade_OnlyWhenNewerVersionAvailable**: `UpgradeCommand` is executed when a newer
version is available (updating the pin and raising release-notes-ready) and when no package
source is configured (raising an error instead). This scenario is tested by
`RepoCardViewModel_UpgradeCommand_NewerVersionAvailable_UpdatesPinAndRaisesReleaseNotesReady`
and `RepoCardViewModel_UpgradeCommand_NoPackageSourceConfigured_RaisesErrorOccurred`, covering
`AgentControl-LauncherUI-Upgrade`.

**LauncherUI_Settings_SaveAndApplyPreservesRecentReposAndUpdatesFields**: The settings
dialog's `SaveCommand` invokes its `onSave` callback and raises `Saved` with the current
property values, and applying the resulting settings on `MainWindowViewModel` preserves the
existing recent-repos list while adopting the new field values. This scenario is tested by
`SettingsWindowViewModel_SaveCommand_Execute_InvokesOnSaveWithCurrentValuesAndRaisesSaved` and
`MainWindowViewModel_ApplySettings_PreservesRecentReposAndPersistsUpdatedFields`, covering
`AgentControl-LauncherUI-Settings`.

**LauncherUI_About_EndToEndOnly_OpensAboutWindow**: No unit test targets the About dialog
directly, since it has no dedicated view-model class; real coverage is end-to-end only,
verifying the About window opens showing the application version and copyright. This scenario
is tested by `windows@AboutButton_Click_OpensAboutWindowShowingVersionAndCopyright`, covering
`AgentControl-LauncherUI-About`.
